## Title of the Project
Adaptive Honeypot Framework for Organizational Threat Detection with AWS Integration
A scalable, adaptive honeypot framework leveraging AWS for real-time organizational threat detection and response.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
The Adaptive Honeypot Framework for Organizational Threat Detection is a dynamic and scalable solution designed to enhance cybersecurity in organizational environments. This framework leverages AWS services to provide a flexible and robust platform for detecting, monitoring, and responding to cyber threats in real time. With its adaptive design, the honeypot adjusts to evolving threat landscapes and attacker behaviors, ensuring comprehensive protection. Key features include real-time monitoring to capture and analyze attack patterns, automated responses based on threat severity, and detailed threat intelligence reporting to improve system resilience. The integration with AWS ensures scalability and efficient handling of high traffic loads, making it suitable for organizations of all sizes. By incorporating advanced detection algorithms, architectural designs, and comprehensive testing, this project aims to provide a proactive and cost-effective solution for safeguarding against modern cyber threats.

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
The Adaptive Honeypot Framework successfully delivers a scalable and dynamic solution for real-time organizational threat detection and response. It efficiently traps and analyzes malicious activities, such as spambots, brute-force attacks, and malware, while leveraging AWS to ensure scalability and robust performance under high traffic. The framework enhances security by triggering automated responses, such as blocking malicious IPs and notifying administrators, reducing manual intervention. Additionally, it generates detailed threat intelligence reports, providing actionable insights for improving cybersecurity strategies. Its adaptive design ensures the system remains effective against evolving attacker behaviors, strengthening the organizationâ€™s overall security posture.
